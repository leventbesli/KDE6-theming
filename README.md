# Lightly-Klassy-Kvantum Setup Script
This bash script automates the installation of the Lightly, Klassy, and Kvantum theme systems on Freshly installed Fedora KDE 6 systems. It also sets up Konsave, a tool for managing desktop configurations, and imports a pre-configured theme profile. This way, you can start with the same theme and settings for each new OS installation.

Notice: This repo includes my otto-lightly-klassy_konsave.knsv file (without icon and cursor pack because of size limitations). You can modify the script and add your own .knsv backup file.
